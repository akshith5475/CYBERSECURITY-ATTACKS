# CYBERSECURITY-ATTACKS
Use of Machine Learning algorithms for designing  efficient cyber security solutions.
With rapidly increment of internet traffic, the 
importance of cyber security also increases significantly. Several 
areas like IP traffic classifications, detection of - intrusion, spam 
and malware becomes important to be considered. To overcomes 
the cyber security issues traditional techniques are not enough. It 
is essential to adapt the ongoing changes to keep security always 
up to date and It canâ€™t be denied that the web of Machine 
Learning keeps increasing in the digital world. The Cyber 
Security also adopt the Machine Learning to overcome the 
limitations of algorithms based on traditional rules and to make 
them more efficient with their integration with Artificial 
Intelligence. Although complete automation of analysis and
detection is enticing goal, but the significant parts of cyber 
security can be improved. In this paper we will see how several 
algorithms of Machine Learning can be used to overcome the 
popular issues faced by cyber security.
